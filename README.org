* Git-Notify 

** Usage

~git-notify ~/my/code/root~

[[https://asciinema.org/a/175481]]

** Installation

   You'll need Roswell. Clone the repo somewhere Quickload can find it (for me that means symlinking my common lisp dev directory into ~~/.roswell/local-projects~. You'll then be able to do ~ros build git-notify.ros~ which will produce a binary you can put anywhere. (The binary doesn't run any faster unfortunately, it's just dependency-free.)
